# R10 prospective price outcomes

R10 COMPLETED LOCALLY, 6 October 2026: same-source, forward-only 3/4/5 observed-session price cohorts are available from future captures. No actual cohort exists yet; B5/historical AI and execution gates remain closed. See [R10 record](../research/PROSPECTIVE_PRICE_OUTCOMES_R10.md) and ADR 0060. No following milestone active.

## Prior R9 record

R9 COMPLETED LOCALLY, 6 October 2026: immutable source-specific OST/IRESS import captures establish an actual observation record and surface subsequent revisions. Unresolved provider definitions are accepted as shadow-research risk, with historical AI/B5 and execution gates unchanged. See [R9 record](../research/PROSPECTIVE_PRICE_EVIDENCE_R9.md) and ADR 0059. No following milestone active.

## Prior R8 record

R8 EVIDENCE AUDIT COMPLETED WITH SOURCE PROMOTION BLOCKED, 6 October 2026. A dated Sasol 2024 corporate-action probe now includes a separate 263-session IRESS daily OHLCV capture; all 263 OST closes and the event-week HLCV observations agree. Broker/Iress chart guides still leave adjustment, volume, revisions and historical as-of semantics unspecified. The next dependency is a dated provider definition, not more candidate stock coding or another event capture. OST remains primary research HLCV; IRESS histories remain local candidates; historical AI/B5 admission stays closed. See [R8 evidence](../research/PRICE_SOURCE_SEMANTICS_R8.md) and ADR 0058. No following milestone is active.

# R7 ViewPoint whole-source verification

R7 COMPLETED WITH NO PROMOTION, 6 October 2026. Sasol and all four registered sector ETFs now have separate, hash-backed local IRESS OHLCV candidates with 250 completed sessions each. All 1,250 compared closes match OST; high/low and volume differences are recorded separately. ViewPoint's copied UTC timestamps are mapped to SAST sessions and the live day is excluded. Provider adjustment, volume, revision and historical availability semantics remain unverified, so OST is still primary and historical AI/B5 gates remain closed. See [evidence](../research/MULTI_SOURCE_PRICE_RESOLUTION.md#r7-viewpoint-check--6-october-2026) and ADR 0057. No following milestone is active.

# R6 multi-source price resolution

R6 COMPLETED, 6 October 2026. Local source-resolution checks now run on dashboard refresh and as part of the existing daily collector. Sasol's separate IRESS full-OHLCV history is a 250-bar candidate aligned on 250 OST closes; archived Yahoo bars remain quality diagnostics, not a fallback. Each of 22 registered stocks has a next acquisition or verification action. The local dashboard accepts bounded IRESS daily exports without credentials; ShareData/JSE require verified export/access contracts, and SharePoint is storage only. There is no field-level blending or automatic research/AI promotion. B5 remains PARTIAL_CLOSED. See [operating record](../research/MULTI_SOURCE_PRICE_RESOLUTION.md) and ADR 0056.

# R5 Standard Bank primary research onboarding

R5 COMPLETED, 6 October 2026. OST-native export onboarding, source receipts, local dashboard coverage and the no-Yahoo-fallback primary JSE research path are implemented. Six instruments are installed locally and uploaded to Railway: Sasol, Naspers, STX40, STXFIN, STXRES and STXIND; the other 16 registered candidates await exports. Browser sign-in stays with the owner and credentials remain offline. Missing opens, HLC errors and unverified provider semantics gate historical AI and real-data admission. Gold/USDZAR need separate source/product contracts; B5 remains PARTIAL_CLOSED. See [operating record](../research/OST_PRIMARY_ONBOARDING.md) and ADR 0055.

# R4 integration completion

R4 COMPLETED, 6 October 2026. Provenance-preserving supplements are installed locally and accepted in Railway PostgreSQL: 250 IRESS Sasol OHLCV bars and 600 OST STX40 benchmark bars through 5 October. Current Sasol numerical preview is AVAILABLE. The original 21 canonical charts, frozen decisions, accounting and historical AI evaluation remain unchanged. Source/action/volume/availability semantics remain unverified and B5 remains PARTIAL_CLOSED with real-data admission false. All 950 safe tests (87.733s), 54 protected checks, JavaScript syntax checks, Windows background-launch verification and visible dashboard review passed. Final web and worker deployments are successful; local and hosted health/overview return HTTP 200. Existing next scheduled worker: 7 October at 08:00 SAST; no manual worker/model cycle was forced. Outcomes remain 25 pending / zero matured per horizon. Genuine fresh exports are required; acquisition receipts expire after four days. No following milestone is active. See [integration record](../research/SUPPLEMENTAL_RESEARCH_INTEGRATION.md).

# Roadmap — reconciled 5 October 2026

6 October R2 COMPLETED LOCALLY: collector consolidated in the main checkout with successful saved upload; dashboard shows runtime-labelled frozen decisions, pending/matured 3/4/5-session labels and control/AI evidence. Railway learning is already scheduled; local zeros are a separate database. Verification: 932 safe tests, 54 protected checks and browser review. Real-data gates and all strategy rules are unchanged. Future observed sessions and complete OHLC remain required; no next milestone active. See ADR 0052 and [connection record](../research/DAILY_LEARNING_CONNECTION.md).

6 October continuation: R1 installed in the main local dashboard; research-first navigation and Portfolio last verified in browser. Local IG credentials are absent. See [main installation](../research/MAIN_DASHBOARD_LOCAL_VERIFICATION.md); hosted deployment and real-data gates remain deferred.

This is the current dependency sequence. [Current state](../CURRENT_STATE.md) is the capability inventory; [recent changes](../changes/2026-09-21-to-2026-10-05.md) is the dated implementation history. Earlier accumulated roadmap entries remain in [the checkpoint archive](../history/ROADMAP_PRE_2026-10-05.md). Old ACTIVE labels there are historical, not concurrent work.

| Slice | Current status | Evidence limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical M13–M16 and durable paper workflow | Implemented | Real costs, liquidity and prospective edge unproven |
| Printable worksheet / manual Demo journal | Implemented | Self-reported fills, no broker order mutation |
| Session-aware daily v3 worker and cash/ETF research separation | Implemented | Exchange calendar and ETF execution not admitted |
| Strategy Profiles and exact version lineage | Implemented | Cards are descriptive, two strategies are placeholders |
| Swing 1.1.0 technical / 1.2.0 policy replay | Implemented research-only | Real OHLC quality still blocks admission |
| IG/Alpha provider investigation and display estimates | Implemented probes/diagnostics | JSE entitlement/coverage unresolved; estimates excluded |
| Local daily archive and cloud 1.3.0 comparison | Implemented bounded research | Zero closed first holdout samples; no automatic promotion |
| Monday brief and local Ollama research flags | Implemented bounded research | Single-publisher first cases, zero flags/boosts/samples |
| Project-wide documentation reconciliation | Completed; acceptance in CURRENT_MILESTONE | No trading behavior/configuration changes |

## Recommended next milestone

Owner decision, 5 October 2026: **B5 PARTIAL_CLOSED; R1 read-only research integration COMPLETED LOCALLY.** ADR 0051 supersedes the historical deferral statements below. R1 exposes verified software/report evidence and provisional source comparisons; it does not certify real-data replay or activate trading. Deferred RAW/action, intraday semantics and real-trade audit gates remain visible. Verification: 926 safe tests, 54 protected checks and reviewed local browser preview. Deployment/configuration and runtime IG checks remain future work; no next milestone is active. See [R1 operating interface](../research/LOCAL_BACKTEST_RESEARCH_INTEGRATION.md).

Latest B5 audit preparation adds an independent 36-case observed-price cash reference with 72 matching directional fee checks; it does not admit data or run engine replay. Source research corroborates dividends and identifies OST ordinary/ADR payment-date mixing. Mandatory cash-source RAW/action and intraday semantics remain unresolved. Execution readiness and unsupported FX/gold are separate from the specification's permitted scoped cash research acceptance. See ADR 0050 and the continuation record; B5 remains incomplete.

Autonomous continuation update: official pilot daily calendar/hours are now captured; OST/IRESS daily prices and volumes match all 23 dates, and native IRESS UTC OHLC matches 177 table rows. Opt-in directional OST fees and 368 post-hoc cost/capacity cases are delivered. 921 safe tests, eight killed defects and 54 protected checks pass. Full B5 remains externally BLOCKED on action/adjustment completeness, intraday interval/volume definitions and execution/product evidence. The following integration milestone remains deferred. See [continuation evidence](../research/LOCAL_BACKTEST_B5_CONTINUATION.md).

**B5: real-data engine acceptance — BLOCKED.** B1–B4 are implemented in an isolated local lane. The resumed full B5 attempt froze 23 daily/368 actual intraday Yahoo SOL bars, verified issuer identity, investigated Alpha/IG and stressed published fees. No complete daily/intraday aggregates reconcile; calendar/action/product/fill evidence still blocks admission and independent real trades. Final software verification passes 906 safe tests, seven killed defects and 54 protected artifacts. See [dated B5 evidence and precise blockers](../research/LOCAL_BACKTEST_REAL_DATA_ACCEPTANCE.md). Complete these gates before the following integration milestone; no adaptive-loop rollout is active.

[Refinement 0.2](../research/SWING_RULE_REFINEMENT.md) now specifies the candidate entry/trailing/exit matrix, volume contribution controls and pooled momentum-personality tests. These proposed parameters still require data admission and implementation; none is an installed or validated rule.

Then, in order (each gate is a separate milestone):

1. B2: deterministic daily replay, trailing and portfolio accounting; conservative fills, costs and causal invariants; preserve legacy replay benchmark.
2. B3: independent FX/gold adapters and synthetic market-specific tests, without broker mutations.
3. B4: bounded indicator selection, nested chronological evaluation, contamination/trial register and eligible/control cohorts.
4. B5: independently audit a verified real-data slice, stress costs/liquidity, compare genuine intraday evidence where available and record engine acceptance/limitations.
5. Freeze six hypothesis catalogues and run local historical candidates plus prospective shadow comparisons. [Feedback design](../research/ADAPTIVE_SWING_FEEDBACK_LOOP.md) keeps indicator reviews independent per hypothesis.
6. Add optional real 30-minute radar/refinement, dated event retrieval and local Ollama categorisation, then selective evidence/control uploads and the feedback dashboard in dependency order.
7. Require sufficient independent prospective evidence and existing risk gates before adopting any research version. No automatic production promotion.

Do not collapse semantic news matching into measured price correlation, FX tick volume into traded-share volume, or historical holdout comparisons into prospective proof. Intraday CFD and long-term investment remain separate later programs. Live execution is outside this roadmap. Exactly one milestone may be ACTIVE; completed historical documents do not start another.

Implementation update: B1 completed locally; see LOCAL_BACKTEST_IMPLEMENTATION.md for evidence. B2 remains next.

B2 completed locally: deterministic replay/accounting with frozen benchmark reconciliation. B3 is next; B5 real-data acceptance remains separate.

B3 completed locally with market-specific synthetic verification. B4 chronological experiments next; real FX/gold execution evidence remains unresolved.

B4 completed locally: bounded indicator trials and chronological locked evaluation. B5 audit/acceptance next. No strategy adopted.

B5 software/audit delivery complete; external-data acceptance BLOCKED. No subsequent milestone activated. 900 safe tests and 54 protected artifacts pass; seven defects killed.


R4 integrates provenance-preserving supplemental IRESS Sasol and OST STX40 charts through dataset v2 for prospective shadow research only. Canonical Yahoo inputs, historical AI evaluation, worker schedule and B5 gates remain intact. See ADR 0054 and SUPPLEMENTAL_RESEARCH_INTEGRATION.md.
